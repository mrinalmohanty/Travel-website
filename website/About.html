    Right from the start, a prominent image gallery does a lot of the selling on the website for Telluride.

By making the images so large, the site makes sure the first thing you see is a beautiful landscape.

This is an example of a site that relies less on copy. Instead of a detail-heavy approach, the design focuses more on the picturesque views and various activities in action.

Once a visitor is drawn in by the photos, they can opt to click on the main call to action, “Plan Your Spring Trip” for more information.

From there, visitors can read about the various activities they can do in the city, then purchase any necessary tickets, passes, or equipment rentals.

This approach works, because it combines attention-grabbing imagery with a clear call to action.

Many Internet users have short attention spans, so it’s important to give them the opportunity to take action as soon as possible.

Don’t make them think, wait, or read too much copy before giving them the opportunity to convert.........

By breaking the country into smaller, more manageable areas, the site aims to create a virtual travel experience that allows the user to explore the sights of Brazil right from their computer.

This can help visitors decide where they want to go within this massive country. If they’re looking for a relaxed beach trip, for example, they’ll have very different options from travelers looking for hiking trips or adventure tours.

Then, once a visitor has selected a destination, the breakdowns on the site will give them an accurate idea of what they can hope to see within the span of their trip.
